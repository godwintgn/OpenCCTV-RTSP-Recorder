# **CCTV Recorder**

This is a Python-based CCTV recording and monitoring system that captures RTSP streams using `ffmpeg`. It provides a **user-friendly GUI**, **automatic recording**, and **storage management** to ensure continuous video capture without exceeding disk limits.

---

## üéØ **Why This Project?**

This script was created as a **free alternative** to paid cloud storage solutions for IP cameras. Many existing tools were either **paid, unreliable, or lacked customization**. This script provides a **local, reliable, and automated recording solution**.

üëâ **Supports both command-line and GUI-based recording!**

---

## **üöÄ Features**

‚úÖ **Graphical User Interface (GUI) for Control**  
‚úÖ **Automatic Recording at Startup** *(Optional)*  
‚úÖ **Syncs GUI with Background Script** *(Detects Running State)*  
‚úÖ **Automatic Recording in MP4 Format** *(No Corrupt Files)*  
‚úÖ **Splits Recordings into Configurable Time Clips** *(Default: 10 Minutes)*  
‚úÖ **Auto-Deletes Oldest Files When Storage Limit is Reached**  
‚úÖ **Monitors RTSP Stream & Auto-Reconnects if Disconnected**  
‚úÖ **Prevents Multiple Instances from Running**  
‚úÖ **Detailed JSON-based Logging (`cctv_recorder_log.json`)**  
‚úÖ **Cross-Platform Support (Windows & Linux)**

## **üñ• GUI Overview**

### **Stopped State**
If the script is not running, the GUI shows a **stopped** status. The **Start Recording** button is enabled, and the **Stop Recording** button is disabled.

---

### **Settings Window**
The **Settings** window allows configuring the RTSP stream, output folder, storage limit, and video clip duration.

### **Running State**
If the script is running in the background (started manually or at boot), the GUI automatically detects its status and updates accordingly.

## **üóÇÔ∏è Configuration**

### **Modify `config.json` Before Running**
Open **`config.json`** and update the settings according to your requirements:

```json
{
    "RTSP_URL": "rtsp://username:password@camera_ip:554/stream",
    "OUTPUT_FOLDER": "C:\Users\Godwin\Videos\cctv_entrance",
    "MAX_FOLDER_SIZE_GB": 50,
    "VIDEO_CLIP_DURATION": 600,
    "CHECK_STREAM_DELAY": 5,
    "DELETE_CHECK_INTERVAL": 10,
    "FFMPEG_TIMEOUT": 5000000,
    "AUDIO_BITRATE": "64k"
}
```

| Parameter               | Description                               |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `RTSP_URL`              | Camera stream URL                         |
| `OUTPUT_FOLDER`         | Folder where recordings are stored        |
| `MAX_FOLDER_SIZE_GB`    | Max storage size before deletion starts   |
| `VIDEO_CLIP_DURATION`   | Duration of each recording file (seconds) |
| `CHECK_STREAM_DELAY`    | Time between RTSP connection checks       |
| `DELETE_CHECK_INTERVAL` | How often old recordings are deleted      |

## **‚ñ∂ Running the CCTV Recorder**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Run from Command Line**
```sh
python cctv_recorder.py
```
üëâ **Starts recording immediately. No GUI.**

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Run the GUI**
```sh
python cctv_recorder_gui.py
```
üëâ **Detects if recording is already running and updates status. Allows manual Start/Stop.**

---

## **üìå Auto-Start at Boot (Windows & Linux)**

### **Option 1: Auto-Start Recording at Boot (No GUI)**
If you want the recording script (`cctv_recorder.py`) to start automatically **without** opening the GUI:
1. Press `Win + R` and type:
   ```
   shell:startup
   ```
2. Create a new shortcut with the target:
   ```
   pythonw "C:\path\to\cctv_recorder.py"
   ```
3. The script will start recording automatically when Windows boots.

üëâ **The GUI can be opened anytime to check the recording status.**

---

### **Option 2: Auto-Start with GUI (Manual Control)**
If you want the **GUI** (`cctv_recorder_gui.py`) to open at startup instead:
1. Press `Win + R` and type:
   ```
   shell:startup
   ```
2. Create a new shortcut with the target:
   ```
   pythonw "C:\path\to\cctv_recorder_gui.py"
   ```
3. When the system starts, the **GUI will open**, allowing you to **manually start/stop recording**.

üëâ **If the script is already running in the background, the GUI will detect it and update accordingly.**

---

## **üìÜ Storage Management**

- **Recordings are stored in date-based folders** (`YYYY-MM-DD`).
- If the total recording size **exceeds `MAX_FOLDER_SIZE_GB`**, **oldest files are deleted automatically**.

**Example File Structure:**
```
üìÇ C:\Users\Godwin\Videos\cctv_entrance\2025-02-23
  ‚îúÔ∏è 2025-02-23_10-00-00.mp4  (10 min)
  ‚îúÔ∏è 2025-02-23_10-10-00.mp4  (10 min)
  ‚îúÔ∏è 2025-02-23_10-20-00.mp4  (10 min)
```

---

## **üõ† Logging & Debugging**

- **All logs are saved in `cctv_recorder_log.json`** with automatic rotation.
- **FFmpeg errors** are captured for debugging.
- **Example Log Entry:**
  ```json
  {
      "timestamp": "2025-02-23T10:00:00",
      "level": "INFO",
      "message": "Starting new recording: 2025-02-23_10-00-00.mp4"
  }
  ```
üëâ **Check logs if the script stops recording or crashes!**
